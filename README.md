## Description

This project is an app for android which allows its users to write a program for a virutal robot, watch him execute the programm in AR and solve challenges by programming the robot.
It is heavily inspired by the programming learning software "Robot Karol".
We based our project on Sceneview, which uses Arcore for tracking and Google Filament for rendering.
The non AR part of the UI was implemented using Jetpack Compose.

## Installation

To install this project use the "releases" section of this github page<br>
Note: *To be able to use this application via the apk, you need "Google Play Services for AR". 
Sadly we are legally not allowed for to offer it for download without uploading the app to the play store.*
