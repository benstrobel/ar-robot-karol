## Description

This project is an app for android which allows its users to write a program for a virutal robot, watch him execute the programm in AR and solve challenges by programming the robot.
It is heavily inspired by the programming learning software "Robot Karol".
We based our project on Sceneview, which uses Arcore for tracking and Google Filament for rendering.
The non AR part of the UI was implemented using Jetpack Compose.
